Q. TSP with 1 ZB cities, KS with 1만개 items.
Q. google with 30 PB.
==> computationally prohibited

Solving a problem (for Normal/Classic problems)
1. design of efficient algorithms (for optimal/exact solution)
2. Analysis: time complexity, proofs, lower bound

Q. if we can NOT find efficient algorithms? => NP 문제
A. 
1. very slow algorithm 채택 for optimal solution
2. optimal solution 포기  => approximate solution 채택
	(suboptimal, near-optimal solutions)
	==> Approximation algorithm (NEW) 설계/분석
3. Massive 병렬화: supercom, GPUs, 분산처리
	==> NEW design: Parallel algorithms. (해당 강의에서 다루지 않음)
